# SVM Image Classification for Cats and Dogs

## Overview 
This repository contains code for implementing a Support Vector Machine (SVM) to classify images of cats and dogs. The SVM is a machine learning algorithm used for classification and regression tasks. In this project, we use it to distinguish between images of cats and dogs.

### Algorithm
Here's a breakdown of the steps involved in implementing a Support Vector Machine (SVM) for image classification of cats and dogs:

1. ***Import Libraries***:
   - Use popular libraries such as NumPy, OpenCV, and scikit-learn for data manipulation, image processing, and machine learning.

2. ***Load and Preprocess Data***:
   - Load and preprocess the images from the dataset.
   - Convert images to grayscale, resize if needed, and flatten them.

3. ***Split Data into Training and Testing Sets***:
   - Split the dataset into training and testing sets to evaluate the model.

4. ***Train the SVM Model***:
   - Use scikit-learn's SVM implementation to train the model.
   - In my case, I had 20000 samples that took so much time for training so I used SGD classifier that gave less training time and good accuracy.

5. ***Evaluate the Model***:
   - Evaluate the trained model on the test set and report accuracy and other metrics.

6. ***Results and Visualization***:
   - Display or save the results, such as accuracy, confusion matrix, or any other relevant visualizations.
